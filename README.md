C# Library for parsing data for present, past, and future MLB contests.

This is very clearly a work-in-progress, but ultimately, I would like to
have support to view a scoreboard on a given day and to have access to a
complete summary of any given game. As it stands, it can pull game ID's,
which means that the code to populate fields in a given game just needs
to be written.
